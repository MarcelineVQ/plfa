pragma's for Nat make later imports of Natural to use Bin impossible

<=-iff-< is worded in a way that I don't understand what I'm supposed to write. do I write <=-iff-< and <-iff-<= ? we haven't written products at this time so it's not a normal iff relationship

I don't understand what preorder reasoning helps us do
In what fucking universe is it more readable? For +-monoʳ-≤ ?
really struggling to see the value of ≡-Reasoning/≤-Reasoning just now

<MarcelineVQ> can I place the cursor over an identifier and ask for its type? e.g. open Eq using (_≡_; refl; cong; co<cursor_here>ng-app)  then some key combo.   or do I have to write something like C-c C-d cong-app<RET>
<mietek> MarcelineVQ: another excellent feature request (if not already requested)

feature request for filling in 'with' rules

feature request for making a skeleton for a type sig we just wrote

essentially all the advantages of idris should be cannibalized and it's weird that they're not



<MarcelineVQ> Is this written somewhere I can peruse? As a human {x y z : ℕ} is expressing Nats labeled as x, y, and z
<mietek> …in an order.
<mietek> https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.6.0.1/language/telescopes.html
<mietek> It should be written here. :P
<Franciman> do you know of any interesting new programming language?
<mietek> MarcelineVQ: https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Docs.FunctionSyntax is barely more…
<mietek> MarcelineVQ: https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Docs.DatatypeAndFunctionDefinitions has some more

<MarcelineVQ> I'll accept there's an ordering, I just regret this wasn't clearer sooner. Certainly it matches the fact that function arguments have an order in the first place. I'm just used to being able to be, less verbosely, choosier about what implicits are brough in scope I guess hehe
<mietek> Are you sure Idris does that?
<MarcelineVQ> And this would probably have been entirely obvious if they were all Nat since the types would align
<mietek> I said, you can `{z = z}`.
<MarcelineVQ> *wouldn't alsign
<mietek> (I also don’t like that.)

<mietek> > This is a stub
<MarcelineVQ> Don't like which?
<mietek> I don’t like that `{z = z}` is ever so slightly more verbose than `{z}` which should really do the right thing.
<mietek> Another feature request?
<MarcelineVQ> Don't like that agda needs that?
<mietek> Yes.
<MarcelineVQ> "feature request: implicit punning (why can't you just be idris)" hehe


The designers at the time must have found the automatic renaming useful somehow, where b is rename a during introduction
foo : {b : Nat} -> B; foo {a} = ?
I wonder how much this conflicts with that desire, or how useful/relied-on that design even is.
